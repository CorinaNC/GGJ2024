    n "It’s a little awkward now that we actually know each other.. "
    
    n "Especially since we’re going to be roommates for the next year."

    Me.c "I thought I told you to stop calling me that." 

    "I felt my face deadpan as the words left my mouth."

    Eve.c "Hey, it’s just habit, how am I supposed to see you as anything other than your edgy middle school syndrome username."

    "She stuck her tongue out, a motion that I physically cringed at."

    Me.c "It’s just a normal username…"

    Me.c "And you’re acting as if you’re not equally as ‘edgy’."

    Eve.c "Not as edgy as ‘Zylothh’."

    Me.c "..whatever you want to believe, Eve."

    Eve.c "LOL that rhymed."

    Eve.c "Man, are you going to be one of those brown nosers who are super anal about attendance?"

    Eve.c "‘cause if so, then I don’t know you at all!  Your majesty-of-Procrastination."

    Me.c "Damn, who do you take me for?  I didn’t even attend most of the classes back at my old University."

    "I wasn’t expecting anything to change from when I lived in my hometown.  The fact that I was even here was sort of a miracle."

    Eve.c "What do those chumps know?  Last time I followed what was on ReviewMyInstructors,"
    
    Eve.c "I got hit with a no-curve test-heavy grading scale."

    Eve.c "The site’s moderation is doodoo and there’s no way to filter who actually knows what they’re talking about."

    Me.c "My experiences with it have been fine, maybe it’s your problem."
