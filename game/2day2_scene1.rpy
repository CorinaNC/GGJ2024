    n.c "If it weren’t for the mandatory first day of attendance policy, I doubt that the classroom would have ever reached its capacity."

    n.c "I put my bags down next to the table, idling before class began…"

    n.c "..and I waited."

    n.c "..and waited."

    n.c "More students stumbled into the classroom."

    n.c "I watched to see if Eve would be amongst them.."

    n.c "But I didn’t see her."

    n.c "Should I text her?"
    
    n.c "Ask her to come to class?"
    
    n.c "Or would that be inappropriate to someone that you just met in person 2 days ago."

    n.c "..."

    n.c "I bit the bullet and pulled out my phone to ask where she was."
