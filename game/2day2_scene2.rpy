    n.c "That would have been fine and dandy but what made it so.. imperious was the fact that it was styled after a throne."

    n.c "The wheels were attached to the bottom of each leg,"

    n.c "Or did he have it commissioned by some poor soul who was probably underpaid?"

    n.c "Another overbearing trait about this guy, outside of his boisterous personality, was a staff that he held in his left hand."

    n.c "His eyes were so blue that they looked like icicles, and he had a dyed strip of yellow hair on his bangs."
    
    n.c "For whatever reason, his hair was long enough to have it tied it up."
    
    n.c "I realized that the staff was accompanied with gloved hands,"
    
    n.c "and the chair’s wooden frame was made even worse with a shade of terrible green that clashed massively with the saturated yellow."
    
    n.c "To make it worse, when he spoke I felt his spit droplets attack my cheek."
