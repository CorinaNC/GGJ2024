    n.c "My relationship with Eve had only recently started.. At least in person."

    n.c "The thing is, we met on the internet a few months ago after she had commented on one of my art posts."
    
    n.c "I’m not usually the type to mingle with strangers on the internet,"

    n.c "but I recognized the character in her profile picture and responded to her comment."
    
    n.c "It sort of evolved from there until we ended up learning that we would be attending the same university."
    
    n.c "Obviously, we went over boundaries, roommate compatibility, and video called enough to the point where we could say we ‘knew’ each other."

    n.c "Though, I was still getting used to her personality.  But for the most part, it was safe to say that she is the person she said she was."

    n.c "I suppose I haven’t made a proper introduction; but are those really needed nowadays?"  
    
    n.c "I guess it’s common courtesy but I hadn’t the opportunity to do something like this before now."

    n.c "I was a design major, for my own sanity."
    
    n.c "But as of recently, I would argue that the justification has been lost."
    
    n.c "Most of my work isn’t up to par with what one would expect from someone who says ‘I’m a design major!’"

    n.c "This is the second institution I’ve studied at, I own an art account where I post some of my stuff."
    
    n.c "I can’t really imagine doing anything else."

    n.c "Overall, there’s nothing much to introduce."
    
    n.c "I’m not that interesting of a person."
    
    n.c "I guess if someone asked for a fun fact, god forbid, I would say that I’m double jointed."

    n.c "But a lot of people are so it’s not particularly intriguing."

    n.c "Eve’s commentary on ‘all University architecture looking the same’ reigned true even for the interior.  "
    
    n.c "I felt a sense of deja vu looking at the white tile pattern on the ground."

    n.c "Honestly, it made me feel a little disoriented simply by the fact that it looked so.. Copy and pasted."

    n.c "It reminded me of my old school."
